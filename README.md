# Data analysis using Python programming

## Data cleaning and preprocessing
drop unimportant columns and drop duplicates

# Data Handling
* Reduce the number of specializations. By using the logic, put every specialization into a category called "other", if the specialization is below 10
* Identify the outliers by scatter plot
* Assign null values with their mean values

## Data visualization
perform by,
* histogram
* scatterplot
* count plot
* pie chart
* heat map-represent the correlation between variables
